# Cash-Register.py
Program designed to simulate how a cash register functions with different, randomly generated customers. Developed to showcase an understanding in object-oriented programming for [IT 209](https://ist.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/IT209Fall2018Syllabus.pdf).

## **Built With:**
Python - uses object-oriented python to simulate a cash register.

## **About:**
The program starts by randomly generating a customer object which contains their name, a list of 5 groceries, and the total of their cart. The user is then prompted to return the correct amount of change to the user. The program will then validate whether the correct amount of change was returned. If the correct amount was returned, a message will be displayed indicating this. Once the customer has been checked-out, the user will be prompted if they want to generate another customer and attempt to check them out as well.
